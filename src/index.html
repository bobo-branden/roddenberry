         Eugene Wesley Roddenberry (August 19, 1921 – October 24, 1991) was an
         American television screenwriter and producer. He is best remembered
         for creating the original Star Trek television series. Born in El Paso,
         Texas, Roddenberry grew up in Los Angeles, where his father was a
         police officer. Roddenberry flew 89 combat missions in the Army Air
         Forces during World War II, and worked as a commercial pilot after the
         war. Later, he followed in his father's footsteps and joined the Los
         Angeles Police Department, where he also began to write scripts for
         television.

         As a freelance writer, Roddenberry wrote scripts for Highway Patrol,
         Have Gun–Will Travel, and other series, before creating and producing
         his own television series The Lieutenant. In 1964, Roddenberry created
         Star Trek, which premiered in 1966 and ran for three seasons before
         being canceled. He then worked on other projects, including a string of
         failed television pilots. The syndication of Star Trek led to its
         growing popularity; this, in turn, resulted in the Star Trek feature
         films, on which Roddenberry continued to produce and consult. In 1987,
         the sequel series Star Trek: The Next Generation began airing on
         television in first-run syndication; Roddenberry was heavily involved
         in the initial development of the series, but took a less active role
         after the first season due to ill health. He continued to consult on
         the series until his death in 1991.

         In 1985, he became the first TV writer with a star on the Hollywood
         Walk of Fame, and he was later inducted by both the Science Fiction
         Hall of Fame and the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of
         Fame. Years after his death, Roddenberry was one of the first humans to
         have his ashes carried into earth orbit. The popularity of the Star
         Trek universe and films has inspired films, books, comic books, video
         games, and fan films set in the Star Trek universe.
